Tiny Lettuce
This recipe is simply how to make good tiny lettuce/salad. I have to say, I didn't realize I was gonna have to make ingredients and stuff, thats why I chose something so simple.
The recipe is mostly just to chop it up, up it in a bowl, mix up a few carrots and maybe tomatoes, or any other food you want in it, then put condiments on it and eat it.
